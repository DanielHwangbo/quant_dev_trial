# Geon Hwangbo

Hi! I'm Geon Hwangbo, an aspiring Quantitative Developer passionate about designing low-latency trading systems and real-time market data infrastructure.

This repository demonstrates my hands-on experience in:

Reconstructing an MBP-10 order book from MBO FIX message streams,

Handling real-time bid/ask depth updates and market microstructure events,

Optimizing performance-critical components using efficient data structures in modern C++.

Built with accuracy, clarity, and robustness in mind, this project reflects how I think about market data processing, systems engineering, and edge-case correctness â€” skills essential for the fast-paced, high-reliability environments at firms like Blockhouse.
